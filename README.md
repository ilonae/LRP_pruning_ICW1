# LRP based Structured Pruning

## Requirements
> Pytorch 1.6.0+ \
> Python 3.8+ \
> pandas


## Reference 
Altered implementation to explain pruning of a skin-lesion classifier on the HAM10000-dataset.
This work was forked from the LRP-based structured Pruning approach stated by Yeom et al., which can be cited here:
